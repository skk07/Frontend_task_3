# Frontend_task_3

I have developed the frontend for six **responsive forms** using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**:

- **Sign In**
- **Sign Up**
- **Forgot Password**
- **Verify OTP**
- **Change Password**
- **My Profile**

### Navigation
- The **index.html** page serves as the front page of the application, displaying the **Sign In** form.
- From the **Sign In** page, users can seamlessly navigate to:
  - **Sign Up** page
  - **Change Password** page
  - **Forgot Password** page
- The **Change Password** and **Forgot Password** forms are displayed as **Modal Popups** rather than separate pages, creating a more fluid and user-friendly experience.
- When users click the **Sign In** button, the **OTP Verification** form is triggered, also opening in a **Modal Popup** for quick access.
- A **My Profile** button is provided in the navigation bar, allowing users to navigate directly to the **Profile** form.

This approach ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience, fulfilling all the assigned requirements.By utilizing **modals**, the application maintains a **clean interface** and reduces the need for multiple separate pages, which enhances user engagement and improves overall performance.
To provide a quick visual overview, I have also included screenshots of the web application, showcasing its layout and functionality.
